#BikeMe

This mobile app will get you anywhere you wanna go within minutes.Imagine getting off of work and requesting a car from a ridesharing service at rush hour. The traffic is insane and you will be most probably paying a surged price. Meanwhile there are motorcycles splitting lanes and getting to wherever they want without a hassle. You could use BikeMe to get to where you wanna go in minutes.
